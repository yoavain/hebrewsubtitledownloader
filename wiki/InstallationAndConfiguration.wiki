Installation and Configuration

= Prerequisite =
  [http://code.google.com/p/subcentral SubCentral] plugin

= Installation =
 Extract files to the folder "SubtitleDownloaders" under your MediaPortal program folder.
  Located by default in:
  <br>32-bit:
  C:\Program Files\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\SubtitleDownloaders\
  <br>64-bit:
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\SubtitleDownloaders\

= Configuration =

 Enable _"SubsCenter.Org"_ provider via [http://code.google.com/p/subcentral SubCentral] configuration.

 == Fine Tuning ==
 In case you find a series that the site supports, but the provider fails to find, edit the _*SubsCenterOrg.xml*_ in the installation folder according to this example:
 <br>
 <br>If _*House M.D.*_ appears in your MediaPortal as _*House*_, and the plugin does not find a match since there are too many series names with "House" in it, you can add specific parameter in the  _SubsCenterOrg.xml_
 <br> the line_*`<series query="house">house md</series>`*_
 <br> means that the local series name _*"house"*_ will be changed to _*"house md"*_.
 <br> You can find the correct value from the url of the series page in SubsCenter.org site. In this case it's:
 <br> _`http://www.subscenter.org/he/subtitle/series/`__*`house-md`*`/`_
 <br>
 <br> Note: You can use " " instead of "-"
